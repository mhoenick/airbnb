The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.<br>
Libraries used in this project are:

- numpy version 1.20.1
- pandas version 1.2.2
- matplotlib version 3.3.4
- seaborn version 0.11.1

## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

When renting accommodations during travel I realised that there are some hosts that keeps the price constant and some that vary the price between business days. My expectation was that the ones varying prices are more expensive and I wanted to know if its true and if so, is it backedup by anything. <br>
During my Udacity Data Science Nanodegree program the first project requires a dataset analysis and hence I took the chance to look into the price variations I was wondering about anyway.

## Files <a name="files"></a>

There is one jupyter notebook available containing the evaluation code and charts for the motivation questions showed above. The evaluation code is supported by respective explainations in markdown cells.
